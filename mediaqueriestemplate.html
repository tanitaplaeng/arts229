<h1> Into The Gloss</h1>
    <p>
      <h2> A No-Nonsense Cleanser </h2>
      Be wary of cleansers that promise you the world. Like a credit card with an airline rewards program, there's really only so much it can do. Most cleansers only call your face home for a matter of minutes—that's simply not enough time to
      brighten, hydrate, tone, clear, and exfoliate all at once. But this is good news, I swear! It means that when you're looking for a cleanser, simple is better. Pick something that'll get the grime off while leaving your acid mantle and existing
      hydration intact. Bioderma Sensibio H2O continues to be the bedrock of any easy cleansing routine. It removes makeup and impurities without leaving a film behind. If you like a more traditional cleanser to lather with water, Indie Lee's
      Brightening (for oilier skin) or Rosehip (for drier skin) Cleansers are my favorite. Wash, rinse, repeat—but not too much. Once a day is probably enough.</p>

      <h2> Something to Exfoliate With </h2>
      But only sometimes! Over-exfoliation (especially when you first discover its skin brightening benefits) is a real and serious problem plaguing our nation. And I hear you—it's just so damn tempting to scrub and scrub and scrub until you're just
      a skull and a pile of dead skin. Take off one layer of skin and all of a sudden you're a shining, wrinkle-less star... So what happens when you take off another layer? Nothing good. That's when you get thrown out of balance—or start
      microtearing your skin—so do your best to start slow. Once a week with some acids could be all you need! Pixi Glow Tonic, the 5% glycolic solution with aloe vera and ginseng available at Target, is the very best for beginners. Paula's Choice
      2% BHA Skin Perfecting Liquid is another cult favorite. I'd be remiss not to mention Biologique Recherche P50, but I'll be honest and say I don't think it's truly a "beginner" product.

  <section>
    <h1>Sun Protection 101</h1>
    <p>Every day. For ever. Non-negotiable. See this as the last step of any complete skincare routine. La Roche-Posay Anthelios is a crowd pleaser, as is Elta MD Broad Spectrum SPF 46 (and a Top 25 alum!). Brennan won't stop talking my ear off
      about Bioré Aqua Rich Watery Essence, so I'm going to slide it in here too.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Because even if you forget to do everything else, you'll always know that you're protecting your skin against the ever-present danger of a sun that is coming to kill us all. Nothing is too alarmist during May, Skin Cancer Prevention Month.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      But like a Pandora charm bracelet (he went to Jared!), you're free to tack on as many add-ons as suits your personal style. If you ask me, I'd suggest picking up a clay or mud mask to have on hand in case you drink too much and wake up oilier
      than usual. Charlotte Tilbury's Goddess Skin Clay Mask is high up on my list, but I just got the Borghese Fango Delicato Active Mud Mask for Delicate Dry Skin (all freshly rebranded, too) and am loving it. Get you a clay mask that won't dry
      you out and there's truly nothing that can stop you.
